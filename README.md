[Project Outline](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md#technical-expectations) | [Heroku](https://otherhub.herokuapp.com)

This is the first individual project of Module 3 at the Turing School. Students have to
use an API, in this case GitHub, to build a clone of said platform. The backend is Rails and
the frontend is built using React.js.

#### Learning Goals

* Learn to consume data from third-party APIs
* Continue to emphasize performance, UI, and overall user experience
* Continue using TDD to drive all layers of development
* Coordinate with project stakeholders to produce quality code and product
* This project will be completed individually over a period of 4 days.

#### Technical Expectations

* Use an Omniauth authentication library for authenticating users with the 3rd-party service.
* Mimic the interface functionality of one online service from the list below.
* Consume an external API to get real data and interact with a third-party service.
